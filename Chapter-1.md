## Assignment Statements, Input Statements
The principal objective of a C++ program is to execute calculations and manipulate data. Remember that data must be loaded into the main memory before manipulation. In this segment you will learn how to put data into the computer's memory. The process for storing data includes these two steps:
1. Instruct the computer to allocate memory.
2. Include statements in the program to put data into the allocated memory.

### Allocating Memory with Constants and Variables
When you tell a computer to allocate memory, you are essentially asking for storage space to hold your data. It is important for you to keep up with where you store the data and which name it is under. Knowing the data type is also valuable information depending on the data type you will handle them differently. You also need to determine whether or not you need to have certain data "fixed" or if it can change throughout the program.
