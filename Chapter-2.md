# Chapter 2 Input/Output

## Objectives
Upon completion of this chapter, students will be able to:

1. Identify input and output streams
2. Read data from the standard input device
3. Define the use predefined functions in a program
4. Describe input stream functions get, ignore, putback, and peek
5. Write data to the standard output device
6. Use manipulators in a program to format output
7. Perform input and output operations using the string data type
8. Distinguish how to use debug logic errors

## Using Predefined Functions in a program
In Chapter 1 we learned that a function is a block of code that only runs when called.
  * an example of a function is ```main``` this function is used to execute autimatically when you run a program.
  * another example of a function is ```pow``` which is the power function it is used to calculate $`x^y`$ in a program.
      * you would use ```pow``` like this pow(2.0, 3.0) = $`2.0^3^.0`$ = 8.0.
      * The numbers x and y that are used in this function are called arguments or parameters of a function.
      * The parameters are 2.0 and 3.0
    * an expression such as pow (2.0, 3.0) is called a function call.
