## Introduction

## Enumeration Type
The three things needed to use an enumeration type are:
1. A name for the data type.
2. A set of values for the data type.
3. A set of operations on the values.

The syntax is as follows:
``` enum class Weekday {
         MONDAY,
         TUESDAY
         WEDNESDAY
         THURSDAY
         FRIDAY
}; ```

The days of the week in this example are considered the enumerators.

### Declaring Variables and Assignment
The syntax for declaring variables of this type is:

``` Weekday day = Weekday::MONDAY; ```

We declared "day" of type "Weekday" and assigned the value "Weekday::MONDAY"

### Operations on Enumeration Types
* With enumeration types math operations are not allowed.
* In order to do them while using enumeration types you must use the cast operator.

## Summary

## Key Terms
1. enumeration type- a user-defined simple data type.
2. enumerators- an identifier used in an enumeration type.
